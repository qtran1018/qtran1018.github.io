                <h2>Splitpush - Group Expense Management</h2>
                <a href="https://splitpush.onrender.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Splitpush 🔗</h3></a>
                <p>Splitpush is a full-stack expense-sharing platform that allows groups to track shared costs, split bills, and settle balances across multiple trips or events. 
                    Users can create trips, add participants, record expenses, and automatically calculate who owes whom. 
                    The system supports both per-trip settlements and global cross-trip balancing, giving users flexible ways to manage group expenses. Mobile support included.</p>
                <p>Created with the help of the AI code assistant Cursor (similar to Anthropic's Claude for coding and Microsoft's Copilot), this was my first project using AI coding assistants. 
                    Although a short project, it gave me insights into how these LLM-based technologies could help accelerate basic development after I had conjured up an idea.
                    <br><br>
                    I realized there was still much of the normal process that needed consideration, but the overall flow remained similar:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>💡Determine the idea. Simple enough, I can come up with some ideas.</li>
                    <li>🛠️Choose a tech stack. I heard Java Spring Boot is popular, and PostgreSQL is widely used, so that worked well. REST APIs are still the most common and I understand them. GraphQL could work, but I'll leave that for another project.</li>
                    <li>🧑‍💻Write some code.</li>
                    <li>🔧QA test and fix whatever broke. While getting help from Cursor, this step felt like the most time-consuming part. Unit tests helped a lot, but there were many tiny breaks that kept popping up.</li>
                    <li>✨Add in more small features and changes until it felt sufficiently complete.
                        <br>In a formal project setting, this would probably involve Change Requests sent to Change Control. Unfortunately for the devs (me), the stakeholders (me) pushed for many changes, so Change Control (me) approved everything.</li>
                </ol>
