                    <p>ðŸ“± Hey there, iPhone user! If you see this, my picture may be sideways as a quirk of iPhones and picture orientation data. If you're not on iPhone... oops ðŸ˜….</p>
                </div>

                <p> ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Quang! I recently earned a B.S. in Computer Science from Western Governors University. 
                    This was actually my second degreeâ€”I pursued it to learn how to build cool things.
                </p>
                <p>My journey into software engineering began at my previous job. Some of the tasks were insanely repetitive, so I started teaching myself automation. 
                    That led to my first internal tool: an Excel VBA macro that turned a multi-minute task into a simple two-button click. Seeing something I made save so much time and effort on a daily basis gave me
                    the motivation to pursue the field in earnest.
                </p>
                <p>Basically, I wanted to work less--<i>I mean</i>, more efficiently. Work smarter, not harder!</p>
