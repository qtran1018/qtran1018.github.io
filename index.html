                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p> Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Quang! I'm a recent graduate with a B.S in Computer Science from Western Governors University. 
                    I pursued my second degree in computer science to learn how to make cool things.
                </p>
                <p>My start into software engineering began at my previous company. Part of the work was INSANELY repetitive, so I started looking up how to automate. That lead to the creation of my first internal tool - an Excel VBA macro that took the tasks from a few minutes down to a 2-button click.</p>
